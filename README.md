## **Amazon Sales Dataset - Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**

### **Project Overview**
This project involves performing an exploratory data analysis (EDA) on an Amazon sales dataset. The analysis helps in understanding various sales trends, product performance, customer behaviors, and other key insights that can be useful for business decisions.

### **Objective**
The main objective of this analysis is to:
- Explore the dataset and identify key sales metrics.
- Analyze trends in product categories, regions, and time periods.
- Provide insights into customer behavior and sales patterns.
  
### **Dataset Information**
The dataset used in this project contains sales data from Amazon. It includes various features such as:
- **Product ID**: Unique identifier for each product.
- **Product Category**: The category of the product.
- **Region**: Sales region.
- **Date**: Date of the sale.
- **Sales**: Number of units sold.
- **Revenue**: Total revenue generated.
  
*Note: The dataset might be cleaned and preprocessed to ensure accuracy and usability for analysis.*

### **Key Steps in Analysis**
1. **Data Cleaning**:
   - Handling missing values and outliers.
   - Standardizing data formats (e.g., dates, categories).
   
2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**:
   - **Sales Trends**: Analysis of sales over time, by region, and by product category.
   - **Revenue Insights**: Evaluation of revenue generation across different categories.
   - **Top Performing Products**: Identifying the top-selling products and categories.
   - **Customer Behavior**: Analyzing patterns in customer purchases based on available data.
   
3. **Visualizations**:
   - Various charts and graphs are used to visualize the findings, including:
     - Line charts for sales trends.
     - Bar charts for revenue by category.
     - Pie charts for region-wise sales distribution.
   
### **Tools & Technologies**
- **Python**: For data manipulation and analysis (Pandas, Numpy).
- **Jupyter Notebook**: Used as the development environment for running and presenting the analysis.
- **Matplotlib & Seaborn**: Libraries used for data visualization.
  
### **Usage**
To run this project:
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your_username/amazon_sales_eda.git
